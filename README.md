# A-Tale-of-Two-HashMaps
This project was the culmination of my Data Structures course.  No built-in Python data structures and/or their methods were allowed to be used.  File hashmap_include.py contains the classes DynamicArray and LinkedList which were provided for this assignment and implemented earlier in the course. File hashmap_include.py also contains two pre-written hash functions for testing. 

The files hashmap_sc.py and hashmap_oa.py contain implementations for the HashMap data structure using seperate chaining and open addressing respectively.  Both implementations of the HashMap class.
inclusive.contain the following methods:
*put() 
*get()
*remove()
*contains_key()
*clear()
*empty_buckets()
*resize_table()
*table_load()
*get_keys()

The hashmaps were tested for storing between 0 and 1,000,000 objects.
